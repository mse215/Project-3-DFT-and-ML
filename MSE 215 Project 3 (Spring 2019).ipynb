    "In this project, you are going to be using VASP (Vienna Ab Initio Simulation Package, https://www.vasp.at) to study the pressure driven structural transition in Si. At standard temperature and pressure conditions the ground state of Si is the diamond cubic structure. The diamond cubic structure is a face center cubic (FCC) lattice with a two-atom basis. At elevated pressures Si is known to have a structural phase transition to the β-Sn structure at a pressure of 15.2 GPa. Both structures are shown below.\n",

    "\n",
    "The figure of the diamond cubic structure is actually shown as a body centered tetragonal structure, hopefully helping you see the similarity between the two structures. (It is always possible to represent the FCC & BCC lattices as a body-centered tetragonal lattice.) This representation also allows one to study the transformation pathway between the phases. Another example of a transformation is the Bain transformation caused by strain that takes BCC to FCC in iron. Here it is possible to obtain both the diamond cubic phase and the β-Sn structures of Si merely by changing the ratio of c/a. \n",
    "\n",
    "We are going to use VASP to predict the hydrostatic pressure at which Si transforms from the diamond-cubic structure to the β-Sn structure. The procedure is straightforward. You will compute the energy as a function of volume for the two crystal structures and then fit the energy vs. volume curves to an equation of state. You can then determine the transition pressure using standard thermodynamic arguments. \n",

    "### Part C: Convergence Tests\n",
    "\n",
    "In this problem you will be analyzing the results of convergence tests. In general, during a DFT structure optimization run the system's energy decreases with little fluctuation and eventually reaches the ground state. Reaching the ground state in this fashion is an example of convergence and is required for a meaningful run. To ensure that a new system converges it is necessary to perform proper convergence tests to avoid any chance of divergence or other situations where your system does not reach the ground state. Running without checking the following convergence can result in you ending up with incorrect results. The two most important convergence checks are ENCUT and the k-points mesh. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Effect of $E_{cut}$ on convergence\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "This sets the energy of the planwaves (PW), which will be included. Only PWs with energies less than this cutoff energy are used in the calculation. ENCUT is generally in the range of 150 – 400 eV, default values for ENMIN and ENMAX are given in the POTCAR file. The value of ENCUT will vary depending on the setup and the system. You must find the correct value for ENCUT prior to any real runs. You will scan through ENCUT for values of 150, 200, 250, 300, 350. You will make a plot of the final energy for each run vs. the ENCUT value. \n",
    "\n",
    "To determine the an appropriate value of $E_{cut}$ for convergence, you will perform structure optimization calculations at 150, 200, 250, 300, and 350 eV. For all of these calculations, use a 6x6x6 grid of k-points generated via the Monkhorst-Pack scheme. For the rest of the VASP flags, use the settings specified in the input files you wrote in Part B.\n",

    "## Problem 2: Determine the Phase Transformation Pressure\n",
    "\n",
    "To determine the pressure at which Si undergoes a β-Sn $\\rightarrow$ diamond cubic phase transformation, you will calculate the energy of the two structures as a function of volume per atom using the input parameters you determine in part 1. \n",
    "\n",
    "Calculating this curve for diamond cubic Si is straightforward - there is only one length scale in the diamond cubic structure, and this is set by the lattice parameter. Simply change the lattice parameter in the POSCAR file. This is slightly more difficult for the β-Sn structure because it is determined by two parameters, not just one. The parameters are a, the lattice parameter, and the ratio, c/a. In principle, at each volume, one needs to vary and c/a to put the crystal under a hydrostatic stress state, while maintaining the volume per atom, $\\frac{a^2c}{4}$, constant. This, however, increases the complexity of your task immensely. We will, therefore assume that the ratio c/a does not vary as the volume is changed. This makes computing the energy vs. volume curve straightforward.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use the same energy cut-off that you found for the diamond cubic structure, but you should check the k-point convergence, which will be slower here since c/a<1.\n",
    "\n",
    "To find c/a for the β-Sn phase, you will need to relax the atomic structure. This can be accomplished using the INCAR flag ISIF = 3. As you learned in lecture, there are a number of flags that can be set to control the run. One is smearing to set the occupation of the electrons. When converging the electronic structure, one computes the energies at a number of k-points, sorts these energies from lowest to highest, and then occupies the lowest energy states. During the course of a structural relaxation, the specific states that get occupied can change (at each k-point there are a number of band states – these frequently have different symmetries and move up and down in energy at different rates as the potential changes during the numerical search for self-consistency). This change typically yields an abrupt jump in the total energy, and can lead to problems in the numerical approach to finding the self-consistent solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "To address this problem, one can employ a physically motivated numerical trick. Instead of making the occupations of the energy levels near the Fermi level strictly 0 or 1, one allows partial occupation of the states. The single particle energy levels in nature is governed by the Fermi-Dirac distribution:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"static/fdeq.png\" alt=\"Fermi-Dirac distribution\" width=\"200\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, $n_i$, is the occupation of the ith energy level $ε_i$ , T is the temperature, k is Boltzmann’s constant, and $μ_i$ is the chemical potential of the particles (this corresponds to the Fermi level T=0). As the temperature is increased, the occupations of the levels near the Fermi level become non-integral. Some of the levels above and below the Fermi level are partially occupied. In electronic structure parlance, this is referred to as occupation smearing.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"static/fd.png\" alt=\"Fermi-Dirac distribution\" width=\"300\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "The benefits of this partial occupation to the numerical approach are obvious. Since the levels near the Fermi level are only partially occupied, the crossing of these levels induced by changes in the potential results in smoother changes in the total energy, and well-behaved numerical routines. Of course, the temperatures at which this smearing is significant are very high. Typically Fermi levels are measured using eV. One eV corresponds to a temperature of approximately 11,000 K. So the smearing in the figure is exaggerated compared to what one expects. \n",
    "\n",
    "Modern electronic structure codes smear the occupations at the Fermi level. Since the magnitude of the smearing one employs is quite large, it is a bit unphysical. Consequently, there is no reason a priori to employ the Fermi-Dirac distribution, and other smearing methods, with optimized numerical behavior, have been developed. This development includes smearing the states while understanding how results can be corrected for the unphysical smearing. In our calculation, we will use Guassian smearing with 0.2 eV (which is large) as our smearing factor. You should check the sensitivity of your answers to choice of smearing. \n",
    "\n",
    "As a consequence of the smearing, we need to consider more than just the bands that we know to be filled in the diamond cubic structure. Hence we increase the number of bands that are computed using NBANDS in the INCAR (NBANDS = 8). This tells the code to use 8 bands for the calculation. Since each unit cell has two atoms, and each atom contributes four electrons, only four bands will be filled (assuming the β-Sn structure is not a band-overlap metal). Nevertheless, we increase the number of bands in order to be consistent with the smearing – we cannot smear the filling of non-existent states.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Apply uniform strains between 0.9 and 1.1 (-10% and 10%) in increments of 1% (i.e. 0.9, 0.91, ..., 1.09, 1.10.) to the equilibrium structures you calculated in Part 1 (the final structures are found in the CONTCARS your calculations produced, which follow same file format as the POSCAR). Perform static volume calculations in which the ion positions are allowed to relax (ISIF=?) and use ENCUT = 350 eV and a 8x8x8 k-points grid constructed using the Monkhorst-Pack method. Otherwise use the same INCAR settings from your structure relaxations. Once you have computed the two energy vs. volume curves, the rest of the problem is straightforward. You will need to fit the results to the Murnaghan equation of state:\n",

Based on your fitted curves (and the resulting parameters) you should be able to determine the lattice parameters and bulk moduli for the equilibrium structures, as well as the transition pressure and volumes for both phases.

This indicates that the cubic dagdeline phase is only metastable at low temperatures.

    "For any students who would like to dive deeper into machine learning, we are hosting a competition for the class. To enter, all you have to do is train a more advanced ML model on the provided dataset and submit your code (along with instructions on how to run it) along with your project. We will test your model on a secret test set. Any model that out-performs our baseline random forest model (as judged by mean squared error on this test set) will receive an extra 10 points on Project 3. In addition, the students who prepare the top 3 models will receive extra recognition and a special prize. You may not use any training/test data than that provided in \"ml_training_data.csv\" but other than that there are no restrictions on what you can try. \n",
